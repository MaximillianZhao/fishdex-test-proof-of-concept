# fished-test-proof-of-concept
Basic CNN-based fish species image classifier. This is a simple proof of concept and not optimized for high accuracy—intended as an initial test for experimenting with CNN architectures and image classification

## Project brief

Develop a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of different fish species. This project serves as a proof of concept to explore the capabilities of CNNs in image classification tasks and to test initial model architectures.

## Scope

* Preprocessing images and setting up a data pipeline useing Keras ImageDataGenerator
* Building a simple CNN architecture from scratch
* Evaluating model performance and identifying areas for improvement

## Limitations

This classifier is a preliminary test and is not optimized for productio use. It lacks extensive data, model tuning, and performance optimizations
